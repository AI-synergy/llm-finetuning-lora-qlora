# Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2 with LoRA and Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for fine-tuning the LLaMA 2 model using custom datasets with techniques like Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The project demonstrates a practical approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments like Google Colab.

## Overview

In this project, you will learn how to:
- Fine-tune the LLaMA 2 model using custom datasets.
- Apply Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PFT) to optimize the fine-tuning process.
- Use LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to adapt large language models efficiently.
- Perform quantization to reduce the model size and make fine-tuning feasible in environments with limited resources.

## Key Features
- **Fine-Tuning with Custom Data**: Learn how to fine-tune LLaMA 2 on your own datasets using advanced techniques.
- **LoRA and PFT**: Implement LoRA and PFT to achieve efficient and effective fine-tuning.
- **Quantization**: Reduce model size using quantization techniques to make the process viable on hardware like Google Colab.
- **Practical Implementation**: Step-by-step guidance to implement the fine-tuning process with clear code examples.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need to install the following Python packages:
- `transformers`
- `accelerate`
- `bitsandbytes`
- `torch`
- `trl` (for PFT and LoRA)

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install transformers accelerate bitsandbytes torch trl
